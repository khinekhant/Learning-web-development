>3. Web Browser

##### Xampp (Apache, mySQL)
[Xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html ) is a free and open source cross-platform web server solution stack package developed by Apache Friends, consisting mainly of the Apache HTTP Server, MariaDB database, and interpreters for scripts written in the PHP and Perl programming languages. We are using the XAMPP server to host the database of MYSQL. Activating the XAMPP server by selecting the XAMPP Control Panel from the XAMPP Menu. After the XAMPP is activated, an icon       appears in the right hand bottom corner of the desktop. The XAMPP Control Panel interface is shown below when you double click the icon.Press the Start button of Apache and MySQL. MySQL will work smoothly when there is no error found in the bottom message box.

##### Text Editor
The text editors are needed to be able to write the code for our project which is the University Accomodation Management System. You can use any of your preffered text editor but mainly 4 of us used either [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)  or the highly popular [Atom.io](https://atom.io/). We can also use our notepad to write down the programming language.  

##### Web Browser
Web Browser is used to view the design of our system and interact with it. On the other hand web broswer is also used to open the Xampp interface and also to start the SQL. A web browser can be used based on our preference either Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Safari or etc.
#### How To Run
In order to run the program first clone this project into your local computer then you have to import the import_this_to_localhost.sql file to phpmyadmin which has username as "root", host as "localhost" and "no password" is needed.

##### CSS
- The Css use in the system include Inline Style, Internal Style and External Style.
- Internal Css is use in the same page of the PHP file.


##### Internal CSS
- Banner Image , This is a internal CSS code we use to adjust and design our banner for the website

![Internal CSS](http://i.imgur.com/o90z9K2.png)

##### External CSS
- Next we have the External CSS, most of the project us use External CSS to design. External CSS is saparated from the PHP file, the code is in another file name style.css , and you need to implement this style.css file into your PHP file.

- This is a External CSS code we use for designing the Admin Menu Bar

- This is the result from the External CSS

- This is the result of footer from the External CSS
![footer bar](http://i.imgur.com/xgytZcR.png)

- This is a group css where all the name of the same name will be effected at the same time. It is very easy to use these because we only need to change one css line in the style.css and all the different PHP design will change together, this will safe alots of time in changing page per page.

- Css that group together with the id , name sections
